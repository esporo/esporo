<p>O terceiro artigo sobre Spore do Joystiq é sobre a versão para celulares. Assim como os dois anteriores, vem com um monte de informações bacanas e vale a lida: <!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Spore Creatures</strong> for mobile phones is launching with the rest of the <strong>Spores</strong> on September 7. I figured that this <strong>Spore</strong> had no chance of infecting me. But after recently playing, I was impressed and surprised by its quality. The graphics -- and even its concept -- would be at home on a DS or Game Boy.</p>
<p>Like <strong>Spore</strong> on the DS, the mobile version of the game doesn't even try include everything from the PC version. <strong>Spore</strong> for phones centers on the Cell Phase of the game. You use the phone's joystick to steer the creature through a slurry of suspended protein and other early life forms, eating objects and avoiding enemies.</p>
<p>But like the other versions of <strong>Spore</strong>, you'll regularly use a creature editor to upgrade the character. While the body part choices are also scaled down, there's enough variety to make the creature your own. Certain parts, like a dangling lure, affect how other organisms behave. That lure attracts food to you, for example. Or you could add a shell for personal defense; hit a button, and hide inside for temporary invulnerability.</p>
<p>The creature customization seems like a lot of depth for a mobile phone game, but <strong>Spore</strong> goes further. After winning the hour-or-so-long game -- it's broken into 18 short levels of several minutes each -- your complete creature can fight friends' creations. Those creatures can migrate to your phone through its network, where they'll battle in an autonomous fight. The better-evolved one will usually win. If you've raised a loser, you can play the full game again to create a new contender.</p>
<p>All of these features make Spore a standout phone game. But it's a looker, too. Sharp, clear graphics present the world, with the bright life forms popping off the backgrounds.</p>
<p>According to EA, <strong>Spore</strong> will be available for every "game-capable phone" on nearly every network worldwide. Pricing will be up to those carriers. Leave it to EA to launch big; at least the company is sticking to one planet.</p>
